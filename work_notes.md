## Monday

1. What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Getting the Flask app to run went well. Adding data to the sqlite file went well.

2. What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I didn't know there's a Flask shell that can be used to manage the database.

3. What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Setting up the pip environment was challenging actually due to errors installing the packages.
